This is my first project on web deevlopment, which I made for the 1 month winter of code WOC 5.0. Initial learnings applied to make a to do list chrome extension that takess care of all your to do tasks.
You can attach the link to some task, the priority of the task and the timer to alert you.
The timer alerts you on the scheduled time.
